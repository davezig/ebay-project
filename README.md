## To do
- [ ] run a simple search using restful app from eBay
- [ ] save results from search in like "search1"
- [ ] run multiple searches at once. use something like 5 text input boxes and run a search for each input box.
- [ ] save each of those searches like search1 search2 search3....
- [ ] do the results have timestamps? can I combine search1 search2 search3 and then sort those combined searches
