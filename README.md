## To do

#### Layout

- [x] create 1 text input box
- [x] create 1 search button
- [x] 1 index page app with a black background
- [x] Setup flexbox the right way with a search bar then the button either to the right or directly underneath
- [x] The flexbox search button is filling up top to bottom in it's row right now. Fix that.
      Move to API stuff for now

#### API from ebay

- [ ] run a simple search using restful app from eBay
- [ ] save results from search in like "search1"
- [ ] run multiple searches at once. use something like 5 text input boxes and run a search for each input box.
- [ ] save each of those searches like search1 search2 search3....
- [ ] do the results have timestamps? can I combine search1 search2 search3 and then sort those combined searches
